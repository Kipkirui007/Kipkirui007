int main() {
     Declare variables
    float hoursWorked, hourlyWage, grossPay, taxes, netPay;
    float overtimeHours, overtimePay;
    float taxFirstBracket, taxSecondBracket;

     Request user input
    printf("Enter hours worked in a week: ");
    scanf("%f", &hoursWorked);

    printf("Enter hourly wage: $");
    scanf("%f", &hourlyWage);

     Calculate gross pay
    if (hoursWorked > 40) {
         Calculate overtime (time and a half)
        overtimeHours = hoursWorked - 40;
        overtimePay = overtimeHours * hourlyWage * 1.5;
        grossPay = (40 * hourlyWage) + overtimePay;   Regular pay + overtime pay
    } else {
        grossPay = hoursWorked * hourlyWage;   No overtime
    }

     Calculate taxes
    if â€¦
Enter hours worked in a week: 45
Enter hourly wage: $15

Gross Pay: $675.00
Taxes: $102.00
Net Pay: $573.00
In this example, the user worked 45 hours at $15 per hour. The program calculates:
Regular pay for 40 hours: 40 * 15 = 600
Overtime pay for 5 hours: 5 * 15 * 1.5 = 112.5
Gross pay: 600 + 112.5 = 675
Taxes:
15% tax on the first $600: 600 * 0.15 = 90
20% tax on the remaining $75: 75 * 0.20 = 15
Total taxes: 90 + 15 = 102
Net pay: 675 - 102 = 573
