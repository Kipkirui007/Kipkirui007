A 2D array scores is defined with dimensions 2x2, which means it has 2 rows and 2 columns.
The array is initialized with the values:
First row: {95, 88}
Second row: {76, 89
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
     i. Define a 2D array data structure
     ii. Declare and initialize a 2D array named scores with 2 rows and 2 columns
    int scores[2][2] = {
        {95, 88},  First row
        {76, 89}   Second row
    };

     Print the elements of the scores array using a nested for loop
    printf("Elements of the scores array:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {    Outer loop to go through rows
        for (int j = 0; j < 2; j++) {    Inner loop to go through columns
            printf("scores[%d][%d] = %d\n", i, j, scores[i][j]);
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
Elements of the scores array:
scores[0][0] = 95
scores[0][1] = 88
scores[1][0] = 76
scores[1][1] = 89
